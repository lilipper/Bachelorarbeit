# Pipeline eval

## This are the evaluations of some models

You can find the matrixes in here and also some gradcam images and videos.
But you will not find the models in here.

In 'results' you can find all the eval for all 33 samples of the pipeline.
The name of the sample folders are showing the real label (lbl_) and the predicted label (pre_) by the model.

In evaluation there are the matrixes.
